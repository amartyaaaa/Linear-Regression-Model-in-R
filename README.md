# SalaryPredictor-using-R
The above ML model uses a dataset to accurately predict the salary of a person based on his/her Years of experience. It uses a small dataset of 20 entries to train the model and 10 entries to test the dataset. The above model was realized in R.

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
The most common method for fitting a regression line is the method of least-squares. This method calculates the best-fitting line for the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line (if a point lies on the fitted line exactly, then its vertical deviation is 0). Because the deviations are first squared, then summed, there are no cancellations between positive and negative values.After a regression line has been computed for a group of data, a point which lies far from the line (and thus has a large residual value) is known as an outlier. Such points may represent erroneous data, or may indicate a poorly fitting regression line. If a point lies far from the other data in the horizontal direction, it is known as an influential observation. The reason for this distinction is that these points have may have a significant impact on the slope of the regression line.
